# AC_Control_via_Arduino
The project aimed to maintain the ambient temperature at a specific level. Infrared signals from the AC remote were recorded using Arduino. Then, when the temperature went out of the defined range, the pre-recorded infrared signals were sent to the AC receiver via LED using PID control.
